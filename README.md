<h1>Labyrinth Generator SDL+CPP</h1>
        Labyrinth Generator is exactly what it sounds like, a perfect maze generating system that allows users to just created them randonmly with the press of a button. It is important to note that this are only the source and header type files, i wasnt sure of how to create a makefile out of this since i work on windows.

<h2>Compile:</h2>
        As i mentioned before; This repository only contains the source and header files, i personally run my batch script including only a folder with dependencies, headers and i link SDL2
