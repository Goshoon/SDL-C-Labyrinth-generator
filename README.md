<h1><b>Labyrinth Generator SDL+CPP</b></h1>
        Labyrinth Generator is exactly what it sounds like, a perfect maze generating system that allows users to just created them randonmly with the press of a button. it is important to note that i work primarily on Windows and run a batch script for compilation on g++ for most compatibility, but everything works properly on Linux.

<b><h2>Compile</h2></b>
        As i mentioned before; I personally run my batch script including only the folders of dependencies and Headers, then it is all linked to SDL2 and ImGui which are inside of dependencies folder.
